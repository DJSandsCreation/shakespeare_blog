                <p>What a piece of work is man, How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty, In form and moving how express and admirable, In action how like an Angel, In apprehension how like a god, The beauty of the world, The paragon of animals. And yet to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor Woman neither;</p>

                <p>So farewell to the little good you bear me.
                  Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
                  This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
                  The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
                  And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
                  The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
                  And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
                  His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
                  And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
                  Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
                  This many summers in a sea of glory,
                  But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
                  At length broke under me, and now has left me,
                  Weary and old with service, to the mercy
                  Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.
                  Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!
                  I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
                  Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
                  There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
                  That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
                  More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
                  And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
                  Never to hope again.</p>

                  All is but toys; renown, and grace is dead;
                  The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
                  Is left this vault to brag of.</p>
